# Detection of Tilted Errors in Bitewing Radiograph using  CNNs for Quality Assurance
an image classification project to detect tilted bitewing radiograph for quality assurance by using CNN, ResNet-50 and Inception Net.

 - This is my FYP project
 - Code is developed to be executed in google colab environment
 - Data (radiographs) was collected from Kulliyyah of Dentistry of IIUM Kuantan
 - Further description of code is documented in the .ipynb
 - Here is a poster of this study
